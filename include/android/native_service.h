/**

 *
 * ANativeService APIs allow you to implement Services declared as
 * {@code android:nativeService=true} using only native code.
 *
 * Because most NDK APIs rely on the Android Runtime (ART), the APIs available to native services
 * (which may not have the ART loaded inside their processes) are limited to a specific subset.
 * The current set of supported APIs is:
 *
 * - AFont_*
 * - AFontMatcher_*
 * - AIBinder_*
 *   - except AIBinder_fromJavaBinder and AIBinder_toJavaBinder
 * - ALooper_*
 * - ANativeService_*
 * - AParcel_*
 *   - except AParcel_fromJavaParcel
 * - APersistableBundle_*
 * - ASharedMemory_*
 *   - except ASharedMemory_dupFromJava
 * - AStatus_*
 * - ASystemFontIterator_*
 * - ATrace_*
